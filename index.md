I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Mathematics at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/) in the group of Prof. [Caterina Zeppieri](https://www.uni-muenster.de/AMM/zeppieri/team/caterina_zeppieri.shtml).

I obtained the PhD in *Mathematics in Natural, Social and Life Sciences* at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](https://www.gssi.it) under the supervision of Prof. [Camillo De Lellis](https://www.math.ias.edu/delellis/) (IAS, Princeton).

I studied at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, where I obtained an undergraduate degree in **Mechanical Engineering** and a graduate degree in **Pure and Applied Mathematics**.
