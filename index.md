I am a first year PhD student in *Mathematics in Natural, Social and Life Sciences* at the [Gran Sasso Science Institute](https://www.gssi.it).

I studied at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, where I obtained an undergraduate degree in **Mechanical Engineering** and a graduate degree in **Pure and Applied Mathematics**.
